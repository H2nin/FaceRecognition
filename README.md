# FaceRecognition
Face recognition using Python.
This project is a simple face recognition desktop application using Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition library.  
The app allows the user to select an image from the computer, detects the face in the image, and compares it with a known face (Rory).

## Features
- Detects a face from an uploaded image.  
- Compares the detected face with Rory's image.  
- Displays the result: "Rory" if matched, or "Unknown" otherwise.  
- Shows the image with a rectangle around the detected face and the result as text.
